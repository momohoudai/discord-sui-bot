# Discord Sui Bot
*NOTE: This project is completed and is no longer maintained because Discord no longer allow my cheap bots to listen to messages in channels. Feel free to reference the code and perhaps build a bot that will be popular enough for Discord to allow that feature for you :)*

A simple Discord Bot written in Golang for friends

- Count keywords in a channel
